    "The first step to solving the problem is subsetting the string. In Python, a string is a just a list of characters. As such, we can treat it like any other list. To select a subset from a list, you can do the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    list[start:end:step]\n",
    "    \n",
    "If left blank, _start_ will default to the first element, _end_ will default to the last, and _step_ will default to 1. For _start_, we will choose element 4 because lists begin at position 0. We can leave _end_ blank because we are going to the end of the string. We set _step_ to 3 because we want every 3rd element."
