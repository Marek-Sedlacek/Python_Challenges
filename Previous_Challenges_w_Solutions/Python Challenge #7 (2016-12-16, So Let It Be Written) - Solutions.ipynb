    "There are times where you may want to write to a permanent location such as when \"saving\" progress along the way to allow you to resume at a later time or writing out to a completion log at the end of your program (to allow tracking later) amongst many other uses.  For this week's challenge, we're going to see the differences between writing and appending.  \n",

    "  - Create a numeric variable i set to 1.  \n",
    "  - Create string variables TempString, VarW, and VarA, each set to an empty string ('').  \n",

    "    - At each pass read in a line from the seed.txt file and store it in variable TempString.  \n",
    "      - If i is an even number: Append the second, fourth, and seventh words of TempString to VarW, adding spaces in between each word.  (Don't forget that the first object in a list is at index 0!) \n",
