    "\n",

    "### Alternate Solution: *For* Loops and Shortcuts\n",
    "Though the previous solution works perfectly fine and follows the instructions to the letter, there are ways we can improve the code to be a bit more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the *y* variable is not necessary. Notice in the above solution, we increment both *y* and *i* by the same amount with each loop. They will always be the same distance relative to one another. If you want to have fewer variables to track and lines of code to write, simply replace all instances of *y* with *i-1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, Python's method of printing a character with each loop adds an undesired space between each letter. Rather than printing at each loop, we can simply append the character to a new string and print the entire text at the end of the process for a bit cleaner result.,\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we could use a *for* loop rather than a *while* loop. Though they accomplish the same thing, *for* loops have the conditions built into their definition so they are less likely to run forever by accident. In the code below, we declare a *for* loop to run for all *i* values in a range between 1 and 71, not including 71. We are using a range, but you could use a *for* loop to iterate through any list of values, not necessarily sequential or even numbers."
