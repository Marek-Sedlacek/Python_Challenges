    "<b>Main Question</b><br> \n",
    "<pre>How many prime numbers are there between 1 and 100?  \n",
    "<pre>(<i>Prime numbers are defined as any number that is only divisible by itself and 1. For the sake of this problem, assume that 1 is not a prime number and start checking with the number 2.</i>)</pre></pre>\n",
    "<pre>There are many possible approaches.  One such approach follows: \n",
    "<pre><b><i>*SPOILER ALERT!*</i></b>\n",
    "<pre>[1] Set up a counter equal to 0.  Create an numerator variable (start at 2).  Create a denominator variable (start at 2). \n",
    "[2] Check if the number in the numerator variable is evenly divisible by the denominator variable.\n",
    "<pre>{A} If it is, then that number is not prime.  No need to test any more denominator variables.\n",
    "{B} If it is not, increase the denominator variable by 1 and check again.  Repeat for every denominator value from the starting one (i.e. 2) to 1 less than the numerator variable.  If the remainder was never 0, then that number is prime!\n",
    "</pre>Reset the denominator variable, increase the numerator variable by 1, and repeat.  Continue to do so until you get to a numerator variable of 100.\n",
    "</pre><b><i>*END SPOILER*</i></b></pre>\n",
    "</pre><b>Bonus Question 1:</b><br>\n",
    "<pre>In addition to increasing the counter, every time you encounter a prime number print out the character at that index within the following string:\n",
    "<pre>'AE1 Uitsrqp nalkj hufednbaabci2t45678 stunwomnotqryed baEFGaI KLponpqrtrvizyxwwmutseqponm kjihgf!#.?!'\n",
    "</pre></pre><b>Bonus Question2:</b><br> \n",
    "<pre>Count the number of prime numbers less than 1,000,000.\n",
    "<pre>NOTE: This is more challenging than it seems at first glance. 1 million is a very large number, and if you're not careful the code could end up running for a long time. When done correctly, you should be able to get the answer with less than 15 seconds of run time, so be sure to test with smaller numbers first.</pre></pre>"
