    "The procedure is very similar to last week’s but with loops (will get the same functionality we got with calling a function recursively):  \n",
    " - Create 3 variables: \n",
    "     - Set i equal to 1, X equal to 100, and Y equal to 0\n",
    " - Set up a loop to run from i to 70 (inclusive).\n",
    " - At the start of the loop, check if i is evenly divisible by 3.   \n",
    "    - If it is, print out the letter at index X.  \n",
    "    - If it is not, check if i is evenly divisible by 2.  \n",
    "    - If it is, print out the letter at index Y.  \n",

    "The applicable part of the course is module 8 (Loops) and we once again touch on the modules we’ve covered before (Math Operations section of Module 1, Strings and Console Output [Module 2], and Conditionals and Control Flow [Module 3]).  If after going through the appropriate sections of the course(s) you still want another example of loop syntax, please note that they’re used in the code for this last week’s treat (the “#Convert target string into underscores” section of the Hangman-ish game).  \n",
